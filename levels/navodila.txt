Nice! Packaging your Pygame game into a real Windows .exe is a great step — and it’s pretty easy with pyinstaller.

Here’s your full guide:
 1. Install PyInstaller

Open a terminal / command prompt and run:

pip install pyinstaller

2. Use PyInstaller to build the .exe

Navigate to your project folder where your main game file is (e.g. main.py) and run:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py

 What the flags mean:

    --onefile: Packs everything into a single .exe file

    --windowed: Prevents a console window from appearing (use for games/GUIs)

If your game opens in a terminal window and that’s fine, you can skip --windowed.
 3. Find your .exe

After it builds:

    Go to the dist/ folder inside your project folder.

    You'll see main.exe there (or whatever your script was named).

 4. Add game assets (images, sounds, etc.)

PyInstaller doesn't automatically include your assets, so:

    If you use images/sounds in assets/, you need to tell PyInstaller to bundle them.

Use the --add-data option like this:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets;assets" main.py

On Windows, use a semicolon ; between paths.

Example if you're using images/ and sounds/:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed ^
  --add-data "images;images" ^
  --add-data "sounds;sounds" ^
  main.py

Pro Tips:

    Run in a virtual environment before building to avoid including unnecessary stuff.

    Use an icon with --icon=your_icon.ico if you want a custom app icon.

    If it crashes after build, use --debug and/or check main.spec file to fine-tune.

 Done! Now you can share the .exe

Just zip the main.exe and any necessary folders (if not using --onefile) and you're good to go!

Want help making an installer (like .msi or .exe setup wizard), or making it run on other OSes (macOS, Linux)? I got you!

yeah, also make installer

Nice  You're really leveling up! Let's walk through how to turn your game .exe into a Windows installer (like a setup wizard with desktop/start menu shortcuts).
 What You’ll Need:

We’ll use Inno Setup — it's free, powerful, and widely used.
 Step 1: Install Inno Setup

Download from here:
 #####https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php#####

Just run the installer — it’s small and fast.
 Step 2: Prepare Your Build Folder

Put everything your game needs in one folder, e.g. MyGameBuild/.
That includes:

    The .exe from dist/

    Any folders (assets, images, sounds)

    A readme or license file (optional)

Example structure:

MyGameBuild/
│
├── MyGame.exe
├── assets/
│   └── ... (your game assets)
└── README.txt

 Step 3: Create the Inno Setup Script

Here’s a starter script you can paste into Inno Setup:

[Setup]
AppName=My Cool Game
AppVersion=1.0
DefaultDirName={autopf}\My Cool Game
DefaultGroupName=My Cool Game
OutputDir=.
OutputBaseFilename=MyGameInstaller
Compression=lzma
SolidCompression=yes

[Files]
Source: "MyGameBuild\*"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: recursesubdirs

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\My Cool Game"; Filename: "{app}\MyGame.exe"
Name: "{commondesktop}\My Cool Game"; Filename: "{app}\MyGame.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop shortcut"; GroupDescription: "Additional icons:"

 Step 4: Compile the Installer

    Open Inno Setup

    Paste or open your .iss script

    Click Compile (green play button)

It’ll generate a MyGameInstaller.exe that launches a full installer wizard 
 Extra Tips:

    Add your icon with SetupIconFile=my_icon.ico

    Use AppPublisher, AppPublisherURL, etc., for pro polish

    You can add a license agreement and uninstaller by extending the script

 Want help making it auto-create save folders or set up settings on install?

Totally doable — just say the word and I’ll add it to the script for you.
